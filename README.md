### Winning Poker Hands

* Steps of the design process and developing for clarity and generality.

* Arguments for program correctness and exprimentation and simulation.

* Design trade-offs; Simplicity and clarity; Decomposition and composability.

### Back of the Envolope

* Back of envolope calculations: When to use brute force and when to be clever.

* The Zebra puzzle: Generator expressions.

* Permutations and combinations.

* Cryptarithmetic; Recursive and wishful thinking; Longest palindrome substring algorithm;

### Regular Expressions, other languages and intepreters

* Defining the language of regular expressions and interpreting the language.

* Defining the set of strings matched by regular expression

* Other languages.

### Dealing with complexity through search

* Search: finding your way with a flashlight or boat.

* Analying the efficiency of algorithm.

* Recurrence relations and matching data types with algorithms.

### Dealing with uncertainty through probability

* Probability: the game of Pig.

* Maximizing expected utility to optimize strategy.

### Word Games

* Managing complexity

* Large sets of words

* Appropriate data structures
